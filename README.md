How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I take responsibility to ensure that my code is functional and secure. 
This includes writing software tests and learning how to avoid security vulnerabilities in my code.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are encapsulated in use cases, or user stories, and are documented in the system requirements. 
Tests are created based on the system requirements, and code is written to pass the tests.

How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software is simple: write the most efficient code that meets system requirements.
